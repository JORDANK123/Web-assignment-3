        <h4>Social Skills</h4>
        <p>I have lots of experince dealing with people due to my job experience at Canadian Tire,
          I have had to deal with every type of person and I've always kept a cool and professional manner when dealing with issues.
          I grew up playing team sports and so I have a great mindset when working in a team and it is easy for me to get along with people.
          An aspect of my personality that came with playing competitive sports is my ambtition to win and also my refusal to quit.

          <h4>Work Experience</h4>
          <p>My work experience includes 1 year at Canadian Tire as a sales associate and I am now employed at Earls.
            My year at canadian tire was beneficial to my self-development in ways that are hard to improve without real life experience.
            I was able to gain self-confidence and also accountability, I decided to leave Canadian Tire due
            to the feeling that I got everything they could offer me and also it was a slow job without much constant action.
            I had a couple friends working at the Earls in dalhousie. I decided to apply and the Head Chef who interviewed me said it was
            one of the best interviews he's had in a while. I am still employed at Earls coming up on my two years with the company. Working in 
            the kitchen is mentally and physically tasking especially at a busy location like Earls, it has improved my ability to work with
            a team and also hold my self accountable when working.

            I am in my first year at Mount Royal University taking a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems.
